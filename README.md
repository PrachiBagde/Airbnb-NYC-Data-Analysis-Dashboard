# 🏙️ Airbnb NYC Data Analysis & Dashboard

### 📊 End-to-End Data Analytics Project using Excel, Python (Pandas & Matplotlib), and Power BI

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze Airbnb listings in New York City using real-world data. The primary goal is to extract insights that can help hosts, investors, and businesses optimize pricing, understand customer behavior, and identify high-performing areas.

The project follows a full analytics workflow:  
➡️ **Data Cleaning** (Excel + Python)  
➡️ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using `Pandas` & `Matplotlib`  
➡️ **Interactive Dashboard** built with **Power BI**

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Excel** – Initial data cleaning, formatting & missing value handling  
- **Python** – Deep data cleaning, transformation, and EDA  
  - `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  
- **Power BI** – Interactive data visualization and dashboarding

## 📁 Project Workflow

### 1. 📂 Data Preprocessing (Excel)
- Removed duplicates  
- Handled missing values (price, reviews, availability)  
- Standardized neighborhood/borough entries  
- Converted data types & cleaned location data

### 2. 🐍 Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)
- Used `Pandas` for:
  - Outlier detection using IQR  
  - Grouping & aggregating price by boroughs/neighborhoods  
  - Host-level analysis for fake or duplicate listings  
- Used `Matplotlib`/`Seaborn` for:
  - Price distribution plots  
  - Availability & review trends  
  - Correlation analysis

### 3. 📊 Data Visualization (Power BI)
- KPIs (Total Listings, Unique Hosts)  
- Borough-wise price & room type comparison  
- Top neighborhoods by reviews  
- Seasonality in availability  
- Most active hosts & top-rated listings  

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Manhattan** has the highest average listing price and availability.  
- **Top-performing neighborhoods** include Williamsburg, Harlem & East Village.  
- Peak booking availability is seen around **May–July**.  
- Some hosts have **100+ repetitive listings**, indicating possible commercial activity.  
- Entire homes are priced significantly higher than shared or private rooms.


## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Optimize pricing in low-review areas for better competitiveness  
- Encourage guests to leave reviews for trust-building  
- Focus on high-demand areas like Manhattan & Williamsburg  
- Seasonal discounts in off-peak months can boost bookings
